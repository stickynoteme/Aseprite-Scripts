# AlignHelper

AlignHelper is based on  Geoff Beier script-center-selection
https://git.sr.ht/~tuxpup/asesprite-script-center-selection

NOTE: Must be using a version of Aseprite using the users APPDATA folder. eg: Not in portable mode, due to mysterious workings of dofile command... on one computer dofile will work proper with realtive paths then on another it simply won't work. 

How to use:
Place the "AlignHelper.lua" file
and the ".lib" folder into your Aesprite script folder.

If you already have a folder named .lib they can be merged together.
If you don't want to use the interface, take out whatever alighment script you want out of the".lib" folder and place it in your Aesprite script folder and use it like any other script.


Offset version:

Note: If you use both versions in one session make sure to reset the offset otherwise it will apply to the non-offset version too.
